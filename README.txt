In order to run the program and play Reversi against the AI, simply run the file "reversi_test.py".
This will initiate a game where the computer makes the first move. When prompted with "Human Move:"
the player will enter the coordinates of the position he would like to play in the input format of
<row_number>,<column_number>. The row and column numbers must be seperated by a comma.

Have fun and good luck.
